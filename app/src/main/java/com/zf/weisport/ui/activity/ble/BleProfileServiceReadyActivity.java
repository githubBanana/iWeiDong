 * The {@link BleProfileServiceReadyActivity} activity is designed to be the base class for profile activities that uses services in order to connect to the

 * activity using Local Broadcasts ({@link LocalBroadcastManager}). See {@link BleProfileService} for messages. If the device is not in range it will listen for
 * it and connect when it become visible. The service exists until user will press DISCONNECT button.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When user closes the activity (f.e. by pressing Back button) while being connected, the Service remains working. It's still connected to the device or still
 * listens for it. When entering back to the activity, activity will to bind to the service and refresh UI.
